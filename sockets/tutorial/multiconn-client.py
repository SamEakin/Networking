# There’s one important difference from the server-side. It keeps track of the number of bytes it’s received from the server so it can close its side of the connection.
# When the server detects this, it closes its side of the connection too.
# By doing this  the server expects the client to close its side of the connection when it’s done sending messages. If the client doesn’t close, the server will leave the connection open.
# In a real application, you may want to guard against this in your server and prevent client connections from accumulating if they don’t send a request after a certain amount of time.
